* React frontend (typescript of course because normal javascirpt sucks!, tailwind)
    * Dynamic routes (for each user on a chat)
        * Each user gets a separate id
        * User will entere in a name when they load the website
            * There can't be a duplicate name
            * So you can message a separately
* Go backend (websockets)
